## Introduction

**HORSE DAO** aims to revolutionize the world of competitive programming by uniting various platforms into a single decentralized ecosystem. We provide participants with the opportunity to monetize their skills, interact with the community, and influence the project's development through a decentralized governance mechanism.

## Mission and Values

- **Mission**: To create an open and decentralized ecosystem for competitive programmers where their achievements and ratings become real value.
- **Values**:
    - **Decentralization**: Distributed governance and decision-making.
    - **Transparency**: Open processes and transactions.
    - **Inclusivity**: Opportunity for everyone to participate.
    - **Meritocracy**: Rewards based on achievements.
    - **Innovation**: Continuous development and implementation of new ideas.

## Problems HORSE DAO Solves

- **Fragmented Ecosystem**: Bringing together various platforms to facilitate interaction.
- **Lack of Unified Reward System**: Standardized system to incentivize participants.
- **Limited Liquidity and Value**: Ability to monetize achievements and skills.
- **Centralized Governance**: Transferring power to the community through DAO.

## Architecture and Components

### Tokens

- **HORSE Governance Token (HGT)**: Governance token for participating in votes and decision-making.
- **HORSE Utility Token (HUT)**: Utility token for transactions within the ecosystem and rewards.

### DAO and Governance

- **Tokenized Voting**: 1 HGT = 1 vote.
- **Quorum and Approval Thresholds**: 20% quorum, 51% or 66% for decision approval.
- **Proposal Procedures**: Any participant with at least 1,000 HGT can propose changes.

### Platform Integration

- **Linking Accounts**: Users link their accounts on programming platforms (Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.) with HORSE DAO.
- **Synchronizing Ratings**: Users' ratings are normalized and used within the HORSE ecosystem.
- **Platform and Participant Tokens**:
    - **Platform Tokens**: Value determined by the HORSE tokens invested in them.
    - **Participant Tokens**: Price proportional to the participant's rating.

## Tokenomics
